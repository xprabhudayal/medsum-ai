My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.

My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):An ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. There are two main types of ulcers- Peptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. How do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. Intense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen.

Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments.

Most work well and should not worsen acne.    * Some cosmetics and other skin care products, however, can cause acne to worsen. Look for make-up, cosmetics, and skin care products labeled with the word noncomedogenic. This means that it does not cause or worsen acne.|Medical Treatment|Many treatment options are available to treat all forms of acne. Medications are the main treatment for acne and usually work well. Several preparations are available over-the-counter, while others require a prescription from a doctor.    * Over-the-counter medications: Nonprescription or over-the-counter medications for acne are plentiful and can be effective for milder forms of acne. They come in the form of soaps, washes, and cleansers.          o Many contain benzoyl peroxide, which does two things. First, benzoyl peroxide kills the acne-causing bacteria, which are thought to play a role in acne. Second, benzoyl peroxide can cause drying and flaking off of skin, which can help prevent the pores from becoming plugged. Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills.

The outermost layer, the epidermis, consists of cells that are drying out and wearing out, continually replenished by the growth from underneath, the dermis. The epidermis can absorb water, allowing it to penetrate the cells and cause them to swell, akin to balloons filling with water. When skin swells, it increases in surface area, resembling a loose-fitting glove with wrinkles instead of a smooth, taut surface. Osmosis, the entry of water into cells, occurs during this process. Prolonged exposure to water can lead to cell bursting, known as lysis. Conversely, when the skin dries out, cells shrink, resulting in a smoother and taut appearance. Proper skin care is emphasized, including avoiding sunburn, keeping wounds clean, and moisturizing during winter.

The exercise concludes by using the right hand to gently guide the head back to the center without engaging the neck muscles.

Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause you to get a cold (acute rhinitis).The virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. Hand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold.Both. Yes, you do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system.Research has shown that being \"cold\" does not make you more susceptible to colds.For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me.  In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs.Another reason I point out the relativity of being cold.  This idea has been around a long, long time.  When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher.  These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of.Still, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether you are in Chicago or LA. It's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold).  It could be that a good number of cases of colds are just \"cold stress\" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather.  I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through.  We have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.  So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter.  But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit.3: When you are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting you from the cold itself.  If you wear the hat and gloves and coat, when you are exposed to germs in the air and on surfaces, you will be more able to fight it off before it makes you really ill\n"}, {"uri": "4376911", "question": "Why do you sweat when under pressure?", "context": "Really, why do you sweat when your under pressure or nervous.

They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS.hey even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.  So, if you do exactly what I say, not only will you have a chance to survive,.it should have immediate effect\n\nSUGGESTION_GROUP: . Go to the website and look up CESIUM CHLORIDE AND OXYGEN DROPS.es. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop..you have to enhance your imune system to fight the cancer once and for all, and improver the blood circulation in the capiliries. to that you have to drink as much as you can of the following;.2/3 (two thirds ) pommegranate juice, (best fresh or frozen)1/3 orange juicea little bit of persian lime juice (mexican lime)  will do.\n"}, {"uri": "1870618", "question": "if a man exchange body fluids with another man is it likely that HIV is transmitted?", "context": "", "answers": ["only if they man had hiv to begin with and if it was blood or seman, infection is highly possible.  saliva infection rate is very low.", "why would you not of picked that as your best answer?

The advice recommends incorporating nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while avoiding starches and sugars that can stimulate insulin production and lead to fat storage. The synergy of a balanced diet and regular exercise is emphasized as the most effective strategy for weight loss, with exercise boosting metabolism and muscle development. The guidance also encourages consuming smaller, more frequent meals to prevent the body from interpreting it as starvation and storing fat. An alternative approach involves the \"rice diet,\" limiting daily calorie intake to approximately 1200 calories through a cup of rice and a piece of fruit per meal, potentially resulting in significant weight loss within a week. For those seeking a more drastic measure, eliminating sugar entirely is proposed, with personal success shared in avoiding white flour and high-sugar content products.

Specific exercises, like butterflies, can be beneficial in toning the chest area, but complete resolution may not be guaranteed, as genetic factors can play a role in this condition.

While it is still a very serious and often fatal disease, it is not the death sentence that it was 20 years ago.  Things like protease inhibitors and strong antibiotics for some opportunistic infections have very much changed the way the disease is managed in a given patient.1: Before you can donate blood you have to be at NO risk for having the disease (as well as several other diseases such as malaria). You are tested before you can give blood to make sure you do not have any blood born diseases. As for doctors, nurses, etc... they are at risk for getting HIV anytime they treat a patient.

However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. \n\nItching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. \n\nProblems with growth are another major feature of PFIC.

It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? People do conquer panic attacks. You can do it!!\nINFORMATION_GROUP: Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation.Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very  severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc.It teaches you to repeat \"I'll Handle It\", which is very helpful during a panic attac.things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances.Second, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your hear\n\nEXPERIENCE_GROUP: .I have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me.I have not had a panic attack in four years.  Where counseling and drugs failed, information worked.  I took a college class on abnormal psychology, and that helped me objectify panic attacks as biological overreactions that had nothing to do with who was really me\n\nSUGGESTION_GROUP: . If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent you may have consulted a mental health professional..would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions.In the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist..meditate.ould recommend Louise Hay's \"Self-Esteem Affirmations\" on CD. You can listen to it over and over again and the positive messages get into your subconscious. I also recommend \"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\" by Susan Jeffers.: you should get away from everything that makes you panic, or just call a doctor they could help you.. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called \"Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry\" that outlines various strategies.First, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. T.Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.Fourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds.

Coping with significant changes like a move and lack of friends suggests a degree of control. Seeking help is crucial, and professional advice is essential to determine the severity and appropriate course of action, whether it involves medication or not. Quick fixes are unlikely in depression, and a long-term approach is recommended. Suggestions include joining yoga classes or finding inner sources of happiness. Emphasizing self-discovery, hobbies, and interests can contribute to overall well-being. Prioritizing good sleep and considering counseling to address underlying issues are also valuable steps in improving mood and mental health.", "EXPERIENCE_SUMMARY": "To navigate depression, individuals employ diverse strategies. For one person, joy is found in activities like playing video games, taking long walks, and participating in online communities. Another suggests overcoming the challenges of moving to a new county by actively engaging in social activities, volunteering, or taking classes. A different approach involves finding solace in faith, with a focus on prayer and connection to Jesus as a source of hope. From a counseling perspective, seeking professional help is emphasized, especially for those affected by the physical aspects of depression in areas with limited sunlight. Overall, a multifaceted approach, combining personal interests, social interaction, spiritual connection, and professional support, is recommended for managing depression.", "QUESTION_SUMMARY": "Follow up questions were asked what exactly the inquirer is depressed about why they refuse to take drugs, and if they have thought about taking some."}, "raw_text": "uri: 646118\nquestion: How do you stop being depressed?\ncontext: exercise I've heard of, drugs out of the question, any suggestions?  I just moved to a big city don't know anyone, so going out with friends is tough right now, plus I work a lot of weird hours with the same old boring people.  What has worked for you?  any tapes I could buy or something.\nanswer_0: How long is a piece of string? Because that's what you're asking. Forget Jesus too. I mean faith has nothing to do with this.

Obviously it's not too bad at the moment because you've managed to cope with a big move, new city, and no friends around you. Doesn't sound like a person not in complete control of their life to me. Gee, can I ask what exactly you are depressed about?So, my point is that you can only be helped if you're willing to let others help you. This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some. Have you thought about that?Overall, my opinion is that I think the first thing you need to do is forget about 5 minute solutions. Depression doesn't work like that.

Don't search for other people or places to make you happy -- it has to come from within.  Once you find something within yourself that makes you happy, the friends and other things start to fall into place.  Search for your own hope in a higher power such as God.

The impact of vaccines, including the tetanus vaccine, has been substantial in reducing the incidence of such diseases. In the United States, reported cases of tetanus are low, likely due to widespread vaccination efforts.

But, anyway, most women ovulate somewhere around the 14th day, beginning counting the day your period starts. Most doctors recommend that if you are trying to conceive and don't have any other health problems that would prevent conception, then have sex from Day 10 to Day 17, especially around Day 14. Do you know when you ovulate? If not, begin paying close attention to your body around this time of the month. Some women experience a clear discharge while others experience a slight pain in their sides. If neither of these work, you can always buy an ovulation test that will let you know whether or not you are ovulating.\nINFORMATION_GROUP: On days when it is clear and stringy, it means you are ovulating..most women ovulate somewhere around the 14th day, beginning counting the day your period starts.

Eat it or take it at the same time.  There are cereals with the daily dose you need also otc medicines you can use everyday.  If this doesn't work ask a doctor.", "Constipation, infrequent or irregular bowel movements, is no fun for anyone. It can be painful and uncomfortable. Constipation can be attributed to at least one of several factors: poor eating habits, lack of exercise, not eating enough fiber or drinking enough fluids, and even possibly serious illness.\n\nFortunately, there are things one can do to prevent constipation.\n\nSince dehydration can lead to constipation, one should always drink at least eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day. It\u2019s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.\n\nA healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation.

Managing stress is crucial, as it can trigger or exacerbate dandruff. Shampooing frequently, especially for those with oily scalps, helps remove excess oil and prevent dandruff. Limiting the use of styling products is advised to avoid buildup on the hair and scalp. A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein contributes to overall well-being. Limited sun exposure may be beneficial, but precautions, like sunscreen, should be taken to avoid skin damage. DERMAREST, available as a shampoo and lotion, is recommended for dandruff management.

It is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute leukemia involves immature blood cells (blasts) that cannot function normally, rapidly increasing in number and worsening quickly. Chronic leukemia presents more mature blast cells, allowing some normal functions, with a slower increase in blasts and a gradual worsening of the disease. Leukemia can affect either lymphoid or myeloid cells, leading to lymphocytic or myelogenous leukemia, respectively. Common types include Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), prevalent in young children; Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), affecting both adults and children; Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), primarily seen in adults over 55; Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), mostly occurring in adults; and Hairy Cell Leukemia, an uncommon form.

The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n\nCan adults get fifth disease?\n\nYes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n\nIs fifth disease contagious?\n\nYes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n\nHow does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n\nParvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n\nHow soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n\nA susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n\nDoes everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n\nNo. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n\nHow is fifth disease diagnosed?\n\nA physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n\nIs fifth disease serious?\n\nFifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy.

Specifically, it is suggested to opt for the intrauterine device (IUD), which is deemed more effective, has a longer duration of effectiveness (up to 5 years when inserted), and lacks the weight-gaining side effect associated with the Depo shot."}, "raw_text": "uri: 4278766\nquestion: Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?\ncontext: And your doctor perscribed something for you to lose the weight cause you have tried everything to lose it and it is not possible to lose?

When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.  It will take you like 1 to 2 minutes a day trying to do like 20.  Thats all it takes to keep your 6 pack.  I used to do crunches.  Elbows to knees.  They arent bad, but this is far better.  Because doing crunches, you might not be able to sit on the floor with your legs out, and lift your body with your two hands without touching the floor.  With these push ups, after you get the hang of it, you can lift yourself off the ground, with your legs parallel to the ground.  This is when you know that you are on your way.  Its the fastest, the best, and the only one that pin points right at your stomach.  Good luck.  Once there, you will need to work a difference excercise for that 8 pack.  People dont say 8 because they dont believe it exists.  It does, and I have it.  I will assist further when you are ready.  Just make sure you rate me hehee...\nanswer_1: crunches!!! They've truly been my key to a \"six pack\"! Knees up, bring head up until you feel the \"crunch\" and back down. Obliques-one knee up, hands behind head and opposite elbow up to knee. Give it a try. It hurts so good!\nanswer_2: Reverse sit ups are more effective.\nINFORMATION_GROUP: Reverse sit ups are more effective..situps are a waste of time.  Some people do like as much sit ups as they can to achieve that 6 pack.some never get it..  Its cuz the muscles arent big enough to show a 6 pack.  There was never enough resistance to get i\n\nEXPERIENCE_GROUP: I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results\n\nSUGGESTION_GROUP: : crunches!!!

In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.InvestigationsSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:abdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. vaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. blood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. hysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. laparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. MRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.DiseasesThe main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:cancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. incontinence of urine. amenorrhoea (absent periods) dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) infertility menorrhagia (heavy periods).

These experiences highlight the importance of personal exploration and tailored approaches to manage diabetes.", "SUGGESTION_SUMMARY": "The best approach to managing diabetes involves three meals a day within your calorie limits, maintaining a consistent meal schedule. Regular exercise, such as walking a dog, has proven effective in reducing blood sugar levels. One individual shares a personal success story, noting a significant decrease in sugars from the 20s to 8 and 10 since adopting this routine. Another suggestion involves eating smaller meal portions, consulting with a nutritionist, and incorporating a ripe papaya every morning on an empty stomach for 30 days. Alternatively, research suggests that consuming the kernel from watermelon seeds can help control high blood pressure. The importance of verification and cautious dietary choices, such as eating radishes or adding vinegar to the diet, is emphasized for natural management."}, "raw_text": "uri: 4367325\nquestion: Does anyone know the best way to lower blood sugar naturally?\ncontext: I am diabetic and trying to get off all the med's the doctors give you that are chemicals and make you gain weight. I am eating a very healthy and nutritional diet(now),and doing alot of exercise 5 days a week.... but my blood sugar is still very high, need help fight this battle.\nanswer_0: According to the \"health gurus\", the biggest single thing you can do is start putting ground cinnamon into your food--the more, the merrier.\nanswer_1: When your blood sugar is high, and you are not taking any insulin (which is I assume is what you are doing), and then you exercise, you are actually making things much worse. Excercising while your sugar is high causes your body to produce ketones. Since you don't have any insulin on board, then your body begins to starve and breakdown fat for energy. The result is ketosis which can be fatal. You need to have some insulin in you, or all the exercise in the world won't help a bit!\nanswer_2: Observe how much meat you are eating.  Around 45% of protein eaten will be converted to glucose when digested.\nanswer_3: Eat smaller meal portions.\nanswer_4: The best way is 3 meals a day within your calorie limits,as well time your meals for the same time every day eg.breakfast 8-30am                lunch  12-30pm                 dinner  5-30pmor whatever works for you.That is the schedule that I have.Exercise with me walking my dog seems to help me.Since Christmas my sugars went from the 20's down to 8 and 10.The moral to my story is get a puppy and start walking your sugars will go down.Hope this helped you a little.Good luck\nanswer_5: Hi, I'm your man for natural health solutions. Unfortunately, I don't really know the effect on diabetes, so check with a nutritionist.There are some things you can try. Eat a ripe papaya every morning on an empty stomach and don't eat anything for 2 hours after that. Do this for 30 days.Alternatively, research has shown that you can cure high blood pressure by eating the kernel out of the seeds of a watermelon. Eat half a teaspoon of the kernel every morning.Hope this helps.\nanswer_6: I am 65 and diabetic for the past 16 years. I have a suffered a whole lot from misinformation and quick answers from people and doctors, who are not diabetic. I was in very serious trouble for 9 years, until 1998. I work in big place and finally I started getting some answers.This is what I did, I am in better control:- I started using Gymnema sylvestre, I take around 10 tablets everyday. It must be taken with meals, since it works on food. Started with one tablet with each meal. You have learn to use it. It will take some time. I tried different brands, the one which I liked is from PURITAN PRIDE (THEY ARE ON THE INTERNET).- During 9 years my sugar used to be more than 350 all the time. Because I was eating very healthy (I thought so), i.e. mostly whole wheat, and other whole grains.Finally I stopped whole wheat, after 7 days my blood sugar dropped to around 180. I am type 2. Gymnema Sylvestre I started about 1 1/2 years after that. Now instead of whole wheat I eat white flower and boiled chicken, lentils, etc.- I was tired of people giving me all kind of suggestions, so I decided to do some work myself. For about couple of weeks I tested my sugar(around 40 times) before and after eating different foods. It gave me most of the facts.  By the way I found sugar from whole wheat sits in your body for 6 to 14 days. - I also learned acidic foods raise blood sugar weight etc.It happens because overacidity is like meat tenderizer. Tissue damage in the stomach does not allow you to digest food properly. Also agressive exercise can also damage stomach tissues, leading to excessive weight. Try avoiding just for couple of weeks see what you find? - Presently I am taking Glyburide, Actos, and Lentus(insulin replacement shots)My recommendation is search google for gymnema sylvestre, and overacidity. also do not trust anybody including you, verify everything, if you can.Good luck. No one know how it feels like to be a diabetic except you. I hope this information could help you.\nanswer_7: To lose weight, I am on Byetta.  It helps me lose the weight & control blood sugar.

Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:\n\nVestibular Rehabilitation Therapy\n    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.\n\n    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:\n\nThe patient's age \nThe ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. \nThe general physical and mental health of the patient \nThe patient's physical strength \nVertigo Medication\n    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. \n\n    The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.\n\n    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.\n\n    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.\n\nVertigo Surgery\n    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.\n\n    I know you're wondering is their a better way, a safer, faster or more efficient way you can permanently deal with your Vertigo. \n \n Finally, You Have A Real Answer, Equitab?\n \nHow Equitab\u2122 is Different for You\n    You only need five minutes and one simple solution for your Vertigo. Equitab\u2122 is the only 100% natural product that works to reduce the symptoms of Vertigo as well as decrease the chances of them reoccurring.\n\nIt's amazing how this simple solution was overlooked for so long before it was brought to you. \n\nHow Equitab\u2122 Was Discovered \n     You'll be shocked when you learn how and why Equitab\u2122 was first made and used. Originally it was used by a small group of test subjects who suffered the symptoms of Vertigo including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, faintness, and unsteadiness.\n\n     Once the Scientists at Selmedica Healthcare, the people who make Equitab\u2122, saw how fast these people received relief from their misery, the product was made available to the public. Since then thousands and thousands of Vertigo sufferers have turned to Equitab\u2122 for Vertigo relief. Because it worked for them you know it will work for you --guaranteed!\n\nWhat Equitab\u2122 Does For You\n     You have to understand that Equitab\u2122 is 100% natural and 100% unique.

Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:The patient's age The ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. The general physical and mental health of the patient The patient's physical strength Vertigo Medication    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone.     The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.Vertigo Surgery    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.

As the muscle contracts repeatedly, the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound. Irritation of the nerves that extend from the neck to the chest can cause hiccups\n"}, {"uri": "4310449", "question": "What are the best foods for liver disease?", "context": "", "answers": ["it depends on your type of disease - hep c or cirrhosis... try to lower your fat and sodium intake at any rate. if i have my studying right, too much fat increases bile secretion, which deposits excess bile salts in the liver. and if you drink alcohol, stop. its sugars are too simple and get processed too quickly (spike in blood sugar levels) making you crave more. which could be said about other simple sugars/carbs. get a glycemic index and try foods with a low g.i. number - more complex carbs take longer to process. i'm no professional, just a college student taking some nutrition classes. try webmd.com. they usually have some good info."], "labelled_answer_spans": {"INFORMATION": [{"txt": "it depends on your type of disease - hep c or cirrhosis... try to lower your fat and sodium intake at any rate. if i have my studying right, too much fat increases bile secretion, which deposits excess bile salts in the liver. and if you drink alcohol, stop. its sugars are too simple and get processed too quickly (spike in blood sugar levels) making you crave more. which could be said about other simple sugars/carbs. get a glycemic index and try foods with a low g.i. number - more complex carbs take longer to process. i'm no professional, just a college student taking some nutrition classes. try webmd.com. they usually have some good info", "label_spans": [86, 732]}]}, "labelled_summaries": {"INFORMATION_SUMMARY": "It's important to note that dietary recommendations may vary based on the specific liver condition.

People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. \n\nMost scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections.

If you had contact with someone who you think might have had herpes, you should get tested as soon as you do see any kind of lesion, where they can sample the fluid directly and test it for herpes virus.  If you don't break out, you need to wait about 8 to 12 weeks from the time you were exposed to get a blood test done for herpes antibodies.  It will tkae that long for your body to produce a detectable level with high certainty.  Be sure to get an antibody test for both herpes 1 and 2, that tests for IgM antibodies.  The standard in this case is a test called the the HerpeSelect antibody test.\nINFORMATION_GROUP: can take up to two to three weeks for herpes to erupt with physical lesions after being infected, so it is possibly too soon to have an outbreak.

Get counseling and take parenting classes, they really help!\nanswer_7: Counseling would be good, but also praying about it and finding a good Church for your family would be a great \"new\" start. Prayer is powerful, and you can do anything through Christ who strengthens you. Good luck, God Bless!\nanswer_8: yes indeed....a counseller is needed in each and every part of our life...however, we may do without it sometimes.as you have said, i strongly opine that you need a counceller.\nanswer_9: one best thing u can do before going to a counselor is to do meditation. try this one for a week. check out the results. u will find the difference\nINFORMATION_GROUP: It is very difficult to change the behaviors of others. It is much more effective to think about why this bothers you so much, and to change the way you feel about and react to their arguing. Family counseling might not be a bad idea if your other family members agree that this is a problem and are interested in changing. But counseling does not work unless those involved have a legitimate interest in changing themselves.I think counseling would be a great place to start, and also perhaps some family couseling..Prayer is powerful, and you can do anything through Christ who strengthens you. Good luck\n\nEXPERIENCE_GROUP: No one can tell you if you need a counselor and sometimes find a good counselor can be a new struggle of it's own.  I am a Life Coach and I have worked with families and individuals in your situation. I would be happy to talk to you, for free and no strings attached.  I could help you explore your options for a possible solution to your situation, as well as possibly provide referrals.  I have a Master's Degree in Counseling and also a Bachelor's in Psychology and would welcome an email at coach@moreauthenticlife.com  or you are also welcome to initiate chat with me.  Good luck and don't ignore an obvious problem.  You, your husband and your kids all deserve better.  Don't cheat yourself out of a happy family, it really does exist for some people! Feel free to contact me.\n\nSUGGESTION_GROUP: I suggest calmly discussing with your family how much of a problem this is for them, and find out if they are interested in changing THEMSELVES rather than changing OTHERS. If so, counseling is for you. If not, you could certainly consider going by yourself to work on strategies to deal with the stress and anxiety this causes you.Look through the phone book for family counselors.Good luck to you.My first response to your question is YES, you should find a family counselor who will work with your family both as a unit and individually- \"ways to feel better about myself, not feel like a failure at life, and feel happy and enjoy each day\"From that statement I would most definately reccoment you seek someone whose philosophys lie in cognitive-behavioral therapy- I think it could really benefit your family.I feel we all need counselors, but they r cvery expensive, and time consuming.You can always try an alternative like going to a really truly trusted friend.Or u can try to counsel ur self, ppl do tat all the time. It's not reccomended, but somtimes it's the only way..arguing and fighting within a family is normal but doing it publicly and regularly is abnormal....if you guys do that then you need serious counselling and if you are unhappy for no reason... a shrink can help you on tha.Yes, definitely you all need to seek counseling. Just asking the question gives me the first clue. But the arguing and fighting could get worse if you do not seek help from an outsider that is qualified to help you and your family. Get counseling and take parenting classes, they really help!.7: Counseling would be good, but also praying about it and finding a good Church for your family would be a great \"new\" start.: yes indeed....a counseller is needed in each and every part of our life...however, we may do without it sometimes.as you have said, i strongly opine that you need a counceller..one best thing u can do before going to a counselor is to do meditation. try this one for a week. check out the results. u will find the difference\n"}, {"uri": "1389303", "question": "Is red wine bad for gout?", "context": "", "answers": ["Alcohol is bad for gout, so yes.", "Don't know specifically about wine but cherry fruit extract is good for fighting gout.

Hepatitis C: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is found in the blood of persons who have the disease. HCV is spread by contact with the blood of an infected person.  Hepatitis D: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a defective virus that needs the hepatitis B virus to exist. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is found in the blood of persons infected with the virus.  Hepatitis E: is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) transmitted in much the same way as hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis E, however, does not occur often in the United States.There is Hep A, B,C, D, and E.  Hep B and C are most common in the US\n"}, {"uri": "4326343", "question": "i would like to stop eating meat, but i dont know what i would eat?", "context": "i have grown up in a very carnivorous family and i am not super fond of many vegitables, so i dont know what i would eat...any ideas or comments? \ni would like to become vegie. for health reasons and also to support my beliefs.", "answers": ["my husband is vegan and doesn't eat that many vegetables, either.  to replace meat, you need to get your proteins from things like beans (excellent source, esp. w/ rice).

Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.Natural occurrence:Food products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. Physical and chemical properties:Aflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins.\nanswer_1: Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide.\nanswer_2: if you live in the united states, who cares?  THis is a disese of 3rd world countries where wheat and other such products spoil and have a fungus in them which produces toxins which promote the formation of liver cancer.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.The exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.The inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.Symptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).Recurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.Researchers are not sure what triggers an attack.
